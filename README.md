### Integration
We distribute Drizzle Studio as a private npm package and here's how in-code integration looks like:
```ts
import type { DrizzleStudioRef } from '@drizzle-team/your-company-studio';
import StudioScript from '@drizzle-team/your-company-studio?raw';


const lightCssVariables = {
  "--background": "#ffffff",
  ...
};
const darkCssVariables = { ... };


function App() {
  // create a ref to the drizzle-studio component
  const studioRef = useRef<DrizzleStudioRef>(null);
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<'light' | 'dark'>('light');

  return (
    <div style={{
      height: '100%',
      width: '100%',
      display: 'flex',
      flexDirection: 'column',
    }}>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}>
        Change theme
      </ button>
      <drizzle-studio
        ref={studioRef}
        css-variables={JSON.stringify(theme === 'light' ? lightCssVariables : darkCssVariables)} // styling 
        title="Drizzle Studio"
        style={{
          flexGrow: 1,
          minHeight: 0,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
